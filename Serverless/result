Differents
    AWS Lambda charges for full provisioned memory capacity, while Azure Functions measures the actual average memory consumption of executions.
    If Azure Function’s executions share the instance, the memory cost isn’t charged multiple times, but shared between executions, which may lead to noticeable reductions.
    Both services charge for at least 100 ms and 128MB for each execution. AWS rounds the time up to the nearest 100 ms, while Azure rounds up to 1 ms.
    CPU profiles are different for Lambda and Functions, which may lead to different durations for comparable workloads.
