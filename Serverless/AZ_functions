Plans
    - App Service plan: provides a predictable pay-per-hour price, but has limited auto-scaling behavior
    - Premium plan: gives reserved capacity and elastic scaling, combined with advanced networking options, for a higher price
    - A Docker container: can run anywhere on self-managed infrastructure
    - Kubernetes-based event-driven architecture (KEDA, experimental): brings functions to Kubernetes, running in any cloud or on-premises
